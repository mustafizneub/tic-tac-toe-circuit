 Circuit for the Tic-Tac-Toe Game

 The goal of the Tic-Tac-Toe Game Circuit project is to create a digital circuit that would simulate the beloved game of Tic-Tac-Toe. The project's goals, design, methods, specifics of implementation, and outcomes are all outlined in this report.

 1. Introduction:
 1.1 Background:
 The project aims to create an immersive and interactive experience by fusing digital circuit design with a classic game.

 1.2 Goals: 
- Create a digital circuit for a game of Tic Tac Toe.
- Put player movements, winning circumstances, and tie situations into practice.
- Use buttons to create a user interface for player input.
- Allow players to reset the game.

 2. Structure and Approach:
 2.1 Conditions:
The Tic-Tac-Toe circuit is created to satisfy the following specifications:
- Permit two players to take turns moving.
- Use LEDs to display the game board. Blue and red represent the first and second players, respectively.
- Determine the winner by looking for eight consecutive winning conditions.
- When the board is full, handle tie situations.

 2.2 Design Decisions:
 - The game state was stored in memory using D flip-flops.
- Used fundamental gates to develop logic (AND, XOR, OR, XNOR, NOT)
- Added a state machine to regulate the flow of the game.
- To prevent errors, divide the circuit into smaller components.

 2.4 Logic Design:
 - Every game board cell has flip-flop logic implemented.
- Created a state system to control game-ending circumstances, move validation, and player turns.

 2.5 User Interface: 
- Select player input with push-button switches and display progress with LEDs.
- Incorporated player movement input handling logic.

 3. Execution:
 3.1 Software Platform: *Digital simulator is used to implement the project.
 3.2 Component Integration: All the components of the logic circuits were joined to produce the final output, and LEDs for the game board display and push-button switches for player input were integrated.

 4. Findings:
 4.1 Functionality:
 - Permitted two players to move successfully.
- Determined the winning circumstances and announced the victor.
Comprehended tie conditions suitably.

 5. Conclusion:
 The Tic-Tac-Toe Game Circuit project accomplished its goals and produced an engaging digital version of the traditional game. The project offers insightful information on user interface integration and digital circuit architecture.

 6. Future works:
Potential future improvements include:
- Improving logic for tie conditions (user experience).
- Hardware implementation of the circuit.
